# Addiction and Escalation Modeling Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and resources related to a research project conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. The project focuses on addiction and escalation modeling using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. It has been supervised by Dr. Dayan and Dr. Lloyd and involves the development of RL models to understand addictive behaviors and their escalation.

## Project Description

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore addiction and escalation phenomena using computational models. The research involves the development and analysis of RL models that simulate addictive behaviors, craving, withdrawal effects, and changing reward structures.

### Key Components

- RL Models: The project utilizes RL models to simulate addictive behaviors, decision-making, and learning processes in agents.

- Dynamics of Addiction: The project investigates how various factors, including mean reward, craving, withdrawal, and changing reward structures, influence addictive behaviors.

- Escalation Phenomena: The research delves into the escalation of drug consumption and the underlying mechanisms in addiction.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following key resources:

- **Code**: The `code/` directory contains Python code used to implement RL models, simulate addiction dynamics, and conduct experiments.

- **References**: The `references/` directory lists academic papers, articles, and books that were used as references and resources during the research.
